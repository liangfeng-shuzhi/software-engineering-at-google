# People management

## Roles

*在做产品的过程中，需要多种职业的同学共同参加，这是google在做事情的时候，需要哪些人涉及其中。*

As we’ll explain in more detail below, Google separates the engineering and management career progression(发展) ladders(阶梯), separates the tech lead role from management, embeds research within engineering, and supports engineers with product managers, project managers, and site reliability engineers (SREs). It seems likely that at least some of these practices are important to sustaining the culture of innovation that has developed at Google.

*每个人在自己的职业发展上晋升，比如产品经理，可以有高级产品经理，或者产品总监，也可以有傻逼。每个职级对应着工资，还有福利，这个很合理，我们就不会有38K的小白运营了，草泥马的。*

Google has a small number of different roles within engineering. Within each role, there is a career progression possible, with a sequence of levels, and the possibility of promotion (with associated improvement to compensation(补偿), e.g. salary) to recognize performance at the next level.

The main roles are these:

+ **Engineering Manager**

*技术能力非常牛逼，还会人的管理，现在主要管人，之前当然是工程师啦。不能不懂技术呀，不然怎么知道别人做的好不好呢，也容易被别人忽悠啊。*

This is the only people management role in this list. Individuals in other roles such as Software Engineer may manage people, but Engineering Managers always manage people. Engineering Managers are often former Software Engineers, and invariably(不变地) have considerable technical expertise, as well as people skills.

*在一个项目中，技术管理和人的管理是分开的，我们也可以采取这样的行为，这样就可以避免傻逼健桦继续在公司里任职了。我们现在是两个合起来的，这就是为啥他们部门混乱的一比，但还是能继续混下去的原因。*

**There is a distinction between technical leadership and people management.** Engineering Managers do not necessarily lead projects; projects are led by a Tech Lead, who can be an Engineering Manager, but who is more often a Software Engineer. A project’s Tech Lead has the final say for technical decisions in that project.

Managers are responsible for selecting Tech Leads, and for the performance of their teams. They perform coaching and assisting(协助) with career development, do performance evaluation (using input from peer feedback, see below), and are responsible for some aspects of compensation. They are also responsible for some parts of the hiring process.

Engineering Managers normally directly manage anywhere between 3 and 30 people, although 8 to 12 is most common.

+ **Software Engineer (SWE)**

*招聘bar是十分高的，只有非常牛逼的人才能进来，这个是指技术上的。还有另外的，要符合公司的价值观，或者基本符合，这个就要看公司的人事怎么来判断了。*

Most people doing software development work have this role. The hiring bar for software engineers at Google is very high; by hiring only exceptionally good software engineers, a lot of the software problems that plague other organizations are avoided or minimized.

*类似于阿里的p线和m线。有些人做技术非常牛逼，但是不想管理人，或者不适合管理人，也要给这些人生存和发展的空间，而避免这些人最终被迫走向人的管理。*

**Like many modern software companies, Google has separate career progression sequences for engineering and management.** Although it is possible for a Software Engineer to manage people, or to transfer to the Engineering Manager role, managing people is not a requirement for promotion, even at the highest levels. At the higher levels, showing leadership is required, but that can come in many forms. For example creating great software that has a huge impact or is used by very many other engineers is sufficient. This is important, because it means that people who have great technical skills but lack the desire or skills to manage people still have a good career progression path that does not require them to take a management track. This avoids the problem that some organizations suffer where people end up in management positions for reasons of career advancement but neglect the people management of the people in their team.

+ **Research Scientist**

*研发科学家，类似于沐神，或者某个学术界的大牛，现在在AI行业，这种职位越来越多，其实干的工作和普通个研发工程师差不多。科学家和工程师两者一起工作，可以把最新的研发成果放在新的产品上，比之前的更古老的实验室方案，更快速，是新的互联网公司的做法。做算法就不需要写代码了吗，也要写工程实现代码。*

The hiring criteria for this role are very strict, and the bar is extremely high, requiring demonstrated exceptional research ability evidenced by a great publication record *and* ability to write code. Many very talented people in academia who would be able to qualify for a Software Engineer role would not qualify for a Research Scientist role at Google; most of the people with PhDs at Google are Software Engineers rather than Research Scientists. Research scientists are evaluated on their research contributions, including their publications, but apart from that and the different title, there is not really that much difference between the Software Engineer and Research Scientist role at Google. Both can do original research and publish papers, both can develop new product ideas and new technologies, and both can and do write code and develop products. Research Scientists at Google usually work alongside Software Engineers, in the same teams and working on the same products or the same research. This practice of embedding research within engineering contributes greatly to the ease with which new research can be incorporated into shipping products.

+ **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)**

*SRE是个啥？运维工程师吗，等一下查查。*

The maintenance of operational systems is done by software engineering teams, rather than traditional sysadmin types, but the hiring requirements for SREs are slightly different than the requirements for the Software Engineer position (software engineering skills requirements can be slightly lower, if compensated for by expertise(专业知识) in other skills such as networking or unix system internals). The nature and purpose of the SRE role is explained very well and in detail in the SRE book, so we won’t discuss it further here.

+ **Product Manager**

*产品经理，或者项目管理？我们公司的傻逼产品和项目，草泥马的。看来产品经理是要跟踪bug，只是咱们的产品经理是个小白。*

Product Managers are responsible for the management of a product; as advocates for the product users, they coordinate the work of software engineers, evangelizing features of importance to those users, coordinating with other teams, tracking bugs and schedules, and ensuring that everything needed is in place to produce a high quality product. Product Managers usually do NOT write code themselves, but work with software engineers to ensure that the right code gets written.

+ **Program Manager / Technical Program Manager**

*原来是项目经理负责收集运营过程中的数据，包括数据处理。我们的项目经理也是个傻逼。*

Program Managers have a role that is broadly similar to Product Manager, but rather than managing a product, they manage projects, processes, or operations (e.g. data collection). Technical Program Managers are similar, but also require specific technical expertise relating to their work, e.g. linguistics(语言学) for dealing with speech data.

The ratio of Software Engineers to Product Managers and Program Managers varies across the organization, but is generally high, e.g. in the range 4:1 to 30:1.

## Facilities

*其实就是有好的、舒适的办公环境，别弄的跟个猪窝一样。让人舒服，并且放松下来，最大限度的榨取剩余价值，包括什么下午的免费水果，下午的免费茶，其实重要吗？一点也不重要，不喝茶你就死了吗？但是也是公司福利的一种。*

Google is famous for its fun facilities, with features like slides, ball pits, and games rooms. That helps attract and retain good talent. Google’s excellent cafes, which are free to employees, provide that function too, and also subtly encourage Googlers to stay in the office; hunger is never a reason to leave. The frequent placement of “microkitchens” where employees can grab snacks(零食) and drinks serves the same function too, but also acts as an important source of informal idea exchange, as many conversations start up there. Gyms, sports, and on-site massage help keep employees fit, healthy, and happy, which improves productivity and retention.

*唯一不好的地方，google的座位非常挤，为了促进人们之间的交流，劳资信了你的鬼。*

The seating at Google is open-plan, and often fairly dense. While controversial, this encourages communication, sometimes at the expense of individual concentration, and is economical.

*座位的变换非常频繁，要根据需要确定谁和谁坐在一起。*

Employees are assigned an individual seat, but seats are re-assigned fairly frequently (e.g. every 6-12 months, often as a consequence of the organization expanding), with seating chosen by managers to facilitate and encourage communication, which is always easier between adjacent or nearly adjacent individuals.

Google’s facilities all have meeting rooms fitted with state-of-the-art video conference(会议) facilities, where connecting to the other party for a prescheduled calendar invite is just a single tap on the screen.
