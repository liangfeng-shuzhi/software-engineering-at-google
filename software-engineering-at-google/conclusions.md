# Conclusions

*行了，劳资就哔哔到这里了，你们看哪条适合你们公司，就拿去用吧，反正也没有唯一的衡量标准，用错了也别怪劳资。*

We have briefly described most of the key software engineering practices used at Google. Of course Google is now a large and diverse organization, and some parts of the organization have different practices. But the practices described here are generally followed by most teams at Google.

With so many different software engineering practices involved, and with so many other reasons for Google’s success that are not related to our software engineering practices, it is extremely difficult to give any quantitative or objective evidence connecting individual practices with improved outcomes. However, these practices are the ones that have stood the test of time at Google, where they have been subject to the collective subjective judgement of many thousands of excellent software engineers.
