# Project management

## 20% time

*在google，20%的工作时间可以用来做自己喜欢做的事情，没啥，我们有更多的时间，但是这严重依赖公司的文化和员工的自觉性，就我们的员工，20%的时间给他们，他们肯定用来刷论坛了，草他妈的。这种习惯是很好的，但是不一定适合所有的公司，这个问题值得好好思考一下。*

**Engineers are permitted to spend up to 20% of their time working on any project of their choice, without needing approval from their manager or anyone else.** This trust in engineers is extremely valuable, for several reasons. Firstly, it allows anyone with a good idea, even if it is an idea that others would not immediately recognize as being worthwhile, to have sufficient time to develop a prototype, demo, or presentation to show the value of their idea. Secondly, it provides management with visibility into activity that might otherwise be hidden. In other companies that don’t have an official policy of allowing 20% time, engineers sometimes work on “skunkwork” projects without informing management. It’s much better if engineers can be open about such projects, describing their work on such projects in their regular status updates, even in cases where their management may not agree on the value of the project. Having a company-wide official policy and a culture that supports it makes this possible. Thirdly, by allowing engineers to spend a small portion of their time working on more fun stuff, it keeps engineers motivated and excited by what they do, and stops them getting burnt out, which can easily happen if they feel compelled to spend 100% of their time working on more tedious(乏味) tasks. The difference in productivity between engaged, motivated engineers and burnt out engineers is a lot more than 20%. Fourthly, it encourages a culture of innovation. Seeing other engineers working on fun experimental 20% projects encourages everyone to do the same.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

*OKRs，其实是用来评估工作的方式，判断这个人有没有完成自己的工作，完成的结果怎么样。目标和关键路径的设置，你的目标要与整个公司的目标吻合。可以想一下，视觉算法部门是否可以采用OKRs来管理我们的小伙伴，如果可以的话，怎样设置OKRs呢，我的OKRs又是什么呢？你可以看到每个人的OKRs，知道这个人做的怎么样，知道他在做什么。*

**Individuals and teams at Google are required to explicitly document their goals and to assess their progress towards these goals.** Teams set quarterly and annual(年度) objectives, with measurable key results that show progress towards these objectives. This is done at every level of the company, going all the way up to defining goals for the whole company. Goals for individuals and small teams should align with the higher-level goals for the broader teams that they are part of and with the overall company goals. At the end of each quarter, progress towards the measurable key results is recorded and each objective is given a score from 0.0 (no progress) to 1.0 (100% completion). OKRs and OKR scores are normally made visible across Google (with occasional exceptions for especially sensitive information such as highly confidential(机密) projects), but they not used directly as input to an individual’s performance appraisal(评估).

*你只能得3.75，没办法得4.0，如果是4.0的话，说明你的目标设置的太低了。设置能够跳一跳够得着的OKR，要努力挑战自己。*

OKRs should be set high: the desired target overall average score is 65%, meaning that a team is encouraged to set as goals about 50% more tasks than they are likely to actually accomplish. If a team scores significantly higher than that, they are encouraged to set more ambitious(雄心勃勃的) OKRs for the following quarter (and conversely if they score significantly lower than that, they are encouraged to set their OKRs more conservatively the next quarter).

OKRs provide a key mechanism for communicating what each part of the company is working on, and for encouraging good performance from employees via social incentives(激励措施)… engineers know that their team will have a meeting where the OKRs will be scored, and have a natural drive to try to score well, even though OKRs have no direct impact on performance appraisals or compensation. Defining key results that are objective and measurable helps ensure that this human drive to perform well is channelled(引导) to doing things that have real concrete measurable impact on progress towards shared objectives.
