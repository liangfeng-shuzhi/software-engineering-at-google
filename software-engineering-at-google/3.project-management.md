# Project management

## 20% time

*在google，20%的工作时间可以用来做自己喜欢做的事情，没啥，我们有更多的时间，但是这严重依赖公司的文化和员工的自觉性，就我们的员工，20%的时间给他们，他们肯定用来刷论坛了，草他妈的。这种习惯是很好的，但是不一定适合所有的公司，这个问题值得好好思考一下。*

**Engineers are permitted to spend up to 20% of their time working on any project of their choice, without needing approval from their manager or anyone else.** This trust in engineers is extremely valuable, for several reasons. Firstly, it allows anyone with a good idea, even if it is an idea that others would not immediately recognize as being worthwhile, to have sufficient time to develop a prototype, demo, or presentation to show the value of their idea. Secondly, it provides management with visibility into activity that might otherwise be hidden. In other companies that don’t have an official policy of allowing 20% time, engineers sometimes work on “skunkwork” projects without informing management. It’s much better if engineers can be open about such projects, describing their work on such projects in their regular status updates, even in cases where their management may not agree on the value of the project. Having a company-wide official policy and a culture that supports it makes this possible. Thirdly, by allowing engineers to spend a small portion of their time working on more fun stuff, it keeps engineers motivated and excited by what they do, and stops them getting burnt out, which can easily happen if they feel compelled to spend 100% of their time working on more tedious(乏味) tasks. The difference in productivity between engaged, motivated engineers and burnt out engineers is a lot more than 20%. Fourthly, it encourages a culture of innovation. Seeing other engineers working on fun experimental 20% projects encourages everyone to do the same.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

*OKRs，其实是用来评估工作的方式，判断这个人有没有完成自己的工作，完成的结果怎么样。目标和关键路径的设置，你的目标要与整个公司的目标吻合。可以想一下，视觉算法部门是否可以采用OKRs来管理我们的小伙伴，如果可以的话，怎样设置OKRs呢，我的OKRs又是什么呢？你可以看到每个人的OKRs，知道这个人做的怎么样，知道他在做什么。*

**Individuals and teams at Google are required to explicitly document their goals and to assess their progress towards these goals.** Teams set quarterly and annual(年度) objectives, with measurable key results that show progress towards these objectives. This is done at every level of the company, going all the way up to defining goals for the whole company. Goals for individuals and small teams should align with the higher-level goals for the broader teams that they are part of and with the overall company goals. At the end of each quarter, progress towards the measurable key results is recorded and each objective is given a score from 0.0 (no progress) to 1.0 (100% completion). OKRs and OKR scores are normally made visible across Google (with occasional exceptions for especially sensitive information such as highly confidential(机密) projects), but they not used directly as input to an individual’s performance appraisal(评估).

*你只能得3.75，没办法得4.0，如果是4.0的话，说明你的目标设置的太低了。设置能够跳一跳够得着的OKR，要努力挑战自己。*

OKRs should be set high: the desired target overall average score is 65%, meaning that a team is encouraged to set as goals about 50% more tasks than they are likely to actually accomplish. If a team scores significantly higher than that, they are encouraged to set more ambitious(雄心勃勃的) OKRs for the following quarter (and conversely if they score significantly lower than that, they are encouraged to set their OKRs more conservatively the next quarter).

OKRs provide a key mechanism for communicating what each part of the company is working on, and for encouraging good performance from employees via social incentives(激励措施)… engineers know that their team will have a meeting where the OKRs will be scored, and have a natural drive to try to score well, even though OKRs have no direct impact on performance appraisals or compensation. Defining key results that are objective and measurable helps ensure that this human drive to perform well is channelled(引导) to doing things that have real concrete measurable impact on progress towards shared objectives.

## Project approval

*对google来说，什么样的项目才是值得做的，什么样的事情才能被批准获取资源，来做这件事。之前看过一篇文章，说必须是涉及10亿人，有大的市场，并且解决的技术足够激进，等等。对我们来说，什么样的项目值得做，那不是老板说了算嘛，我们管个蛋用。后面大姐来了之后，就是这傻逼说了算，我操你妈，都是啥人？！*

*作者说的好直接，哈哈，google也是拍脑袋嘛，大家都是一样的，只不过google用非常有前瞻性的人来拍脑袋，我们用小苏来拍脑袋，这个是本质上的区别。*

Although there is a well-defined process for launch approvals, Google does not have a well-defined process for project approval or cancellation. Despite having been at Google for over 10 years, and now having become a manager myself, I still don’t fully understand how such decisions are made. In part this is because the approach to this is not uniform across the company. Managers at every level are responsible and accountable for what projects their teams work on, and exercise their discretion as they see fit. In some cases, this means that such decisions are made in a quite bottom-up fashion, with engineers being given freedom to choose which projects to work on, within their team’s scope. In other cases, such decisions are made in a much more top-down fashion, with executives or managers making decisions about which projects will go ahead, which will get additional resources, and which will get cancelled.

## Corporate reorganizations

*公司或者部门的重组，可能在大的公司发生的比较频繁，某个项目失败了，那就打碎重组，这群人再去干别的。公司业务的一些调整，会导致部门的重组，那这群小伙伴怎么办，开掉吗？*

Occasionally an executive decision is made to cancel a large project, and then the many engineers who had been working on that project may have to find new projects on new teams. Similarly there have been occasional “defragmentation(重组)” efforts, where projects that are split across multiple geographic locations are consolidated into a smaller number of locations, with engineers in some locations being required to change team and/or project in order to achieve this. In such cases, engineers are generally given freedom to choose their new team and role from within the positions available in their geographic location, or in the case of defragmentation, they may also be given the option of staying on the same team and project by moving to a different location.

*从正面和发展的角度，来看待公司项目和人员构成的重组，毕竟需要跟随趋势而变化嘛。shipping the org chart不知道什么意思，需要再查一下，看看有啥作用，为啥可以减弱这个问题。*

In addition, other kinds of corporate reorganizations, such as merging or splitting teams and changes in reporting chains, seem to be fairly frequent occurrences, although I don’t know how Google compares with other large companies on that. In a large, technology-driven organization, somewhat frequent reorganization may be necessary to avoid organizational inefficiencies as the technology and requirements change. They can help to avoid or mitigate(缓和) the common problem in large organizations of “shipping the org chart”, where the software architecture reflects the organization’s reporting structure.

## Annual hack weeks

*每年都会有一周的时间，让工程师把自己做的好玩的、牛逼的、有趣的东西拿出来展示，然后评选个奖项。难道借助马拉松，叫它黑客松？先开一个小会，大家一起想点子，做啥东西，然后组队，用一周的课余时间，把这个东西弄出来，然后展示给大家。有可能这个项目会做成全职的项目，这是最大的奖励。*

Another way in which Google encourages innovation is by holding “hackathons”. In many Google offices, this takes the form of an annual week-long “hackathon” in which software engineers can take time out of their regular schedule to work on new innovative projects. After a kick-off meeting in which people can pitch ideas, they form small teams that spend a week building a demo or prototype based on a new idea, and at the end of the week present their demos to an audience(听众) and a panel of judges, who award (small) prizes for the best projects. The biggest rewards, though, are the recognition(承认) — and the chance to have a successful hackathon project graduate to become a full-time real project.

Despite all engineers being given permission from their site lead to participate in such hackathons, many engineers do find it difficult to detach from their day-to-day responsibilities, and so participation rates are generally fairly low (e.g. 5-20%), although many more will attend the initial kick-off and/or the final presentations and may get inspired by the ideas presented.
