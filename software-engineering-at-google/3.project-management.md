# Project management

## 20% time

*在google，20%的工作时间可以用来做自己喜欢做的事情，没啥，我们有更多的时间，但是这严重依赖公司的文化和员工的自觉性，就我们的员工，20%的时间给他们，他们肯定用来刷论坛了，草他妈的。这种习惯是很好的，但是不一定适合所有的公司，这个问题值得好好思考一下。*

**Engineers are permitted to spend up to 20% of their time working on any project of their choice, without needing approval from their manager or anyone else.** This trust in engineers is extremely valuable, for several reasons. Firstly, it allows anyone with a good idea, even if it is an idea that others would not immediately recognize as being worthwhile, to have sufficient time to develop a prototype, demo, or presentation to show the value of their idea. Secondly, it provides management with visibility into activity that might otherwise be hidden. In other companies that don’t have an official policy of allowing 20% time, engineers sometimes work on “skunkwork” projects without informing management. It’s much better if engineers can be open about such projects, describing their work on such projects in their regular status updates, even in cases where their management may not agree on the value of the project. Having a company-wide official policy and a culture that supports it makes this possible. Thirdly, by allowing engineers to spend a small portion of their time working on more fun stuff, it keeps engineers motivated and excited by what they do, and stops them getting burnt out, which can easily happen if they feel compelled to spend 100% of their time working on more tedious(乏味) tasks. The difference in productivity between engaged, motivated engineers and burnt out engineers is a lot more than 20%. Fourthly, it encourages a culture of innovation. Seeing other engineers working on fun experimental 20% projects encourages everyone to do the same.
