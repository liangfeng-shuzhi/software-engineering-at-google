# Project management

## 20% time

**Engineers are permitted to spend up to 20% of their time working on any project of their choice, without needing approval from their manager or anyone else.** This trust in engineers is extremely valuable, for several reasons. Firstly, it allows anyone with a good idea, even if it is an idea that others would not immediately recognize as being worthwhile, to have sufficient time to develop a prototype, demo, or presentation to show the value of their idea. Secondly, it provides management with visibility into activity that might otherwise be hidden. In other companies that don’t have an official policy of allowing 20% time, engineers sometimes work on “skunkwork” projects without informing management. It’s much better if engineers can be open about such projects, describing their work on such projects in their regular status updates, even in cases where their management may not agree on the value of the project. Having a company-wide official policy and a culture that supports it makes this possible. Thirdly, by allowing engineers to spend a small portion of their time working on more fun stuff, it keeps engineers motivated and excited by what they do, and stops them getting burnt out, which can easily happen if they feel compelled to spend 100% of their time working on more tedious(乏味) tasks. The difference in productivity between engaged, motivated engineers and burnt out engineers is a lot more than 20%. Fourthly, it encourages a culture of innovation. Seeing other engineers working on fun experimental 20% projects encourages everyone to do the same.

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

**Individuals and teams at Google are required to explicitly document their goals and to assess their progress towards these goals.** Teams set quarterly and annual(年度) objectives, with measurable key results that show progress towards these objectives. This is done at every level of the company, going all the way up to defining goals for the whole company. Goals for individuals and small teams should align with the higher-level goals for the broader teams that they are part of and with the overall company goals. At the end of each quarter, progress towards the measurable key results is recorded and each objective is given a score from 0.0 (no progress) to 1.0 (100% completion). OKRs and OKR scores are normally made visible across Google (with occasional exceptions for especially sensitive information such as highly confidential(机密) projects), but they not used directly as input to an individual’s performance appraisal(评估).

OKRs should be set high: the desired target overall average score is 65%, meaning that a team is encouraged to set as goals about 50% more tasks than they are likely to actually accomplish. If a team scores significantly higher than that, they are encouraged to set more ambitious(雄心勃勃的) OKRs for the following quarter (and conversely if they score significantly lower than that, they are encouraged to set their OKRs more conservatively the next quarter).

OKRs provide a key mechanism for communicating what each part of the company is working on, and for encouraging good performance from employees via social incentives(激励措施)… engineers know that their team will have a meeting where the OKRs will be scored, and have a natural drive to try to score well, even though OKRs have no direct impact on performance appraisals or compensation. Defining key results that are objective and measurable helps ensure that this human drive to perform well is channelled(引导) to doing things that have real concrete measurable impact on progress towards shared objectives.

## Project approval

Although there is a well-defined process for launch approvals, Google does not have a well-defined process for project approval or cancellation. Despite having been at Google for over 10 years, and now having become a manager myself, I still don’t fully understand how such decisions are made. In part this is because the approach to this is not uniform across the company. Managers at every level are responsible and accountable for what projects their teams work on, and exercise their discretion as they see fit. In some cases, this means that such decisions are made in a quite bottom-up fashion, with engineers being given freedom to choose which projects to work on, within their team’s scope. In other cases, such decisions are made in a much more top-down fashion, with executives or managers making decisions about which projects will go ahead, which will get additional resources, and which will get cancelled.

## Corporate reorganizations

Occasionally an executive decision is made to cancel a large project, and then the many engineers who had been working on that project may have to find new projects on new teams. Similarly there have been occasional “defragmentation(重组)” efforts, where projects that are split across multiple geographic locations are consolidated into a smaller number of locations, with engineers in some locations being required to change team and/or project in order to achieve this. In such cases, engineers are generally given freedom to choose their new team and role from within the positions available in their geographic location, or in the case of defragmentation, they may also be given the option of staying on the same team and project by moving to a different location.

In addition, other kinds of corporate reorganizations, such as merging or splitting teams and changes in reporting chains, seem to be fairly frequent occurrences, although I don’t know how Google compares with other large companies on that. In a large, technology-driven organization, somewhat frequent reorganization may be necessary to avoid organizational inefficiencies as the technology and requirements change. They can help to avoid or mitigate(缓和) the common problem in large organizations of “shipping the org chart”, where the software architecture reflects the organization’s reporting structure.

## Annual hack weeks

Another way in which Google encourages innovation is by holding “hackathons”. In many Google offices, this takes the form of an annual week-long “hackathon” in which software engineers can take time out of their regular schedule to work on new innovative projects. After a kick-off meeting in which people can pitch ideas, they form small teams that spend a week building a demo or prototype based on a new idea, and at the end of the week present their demos to an audience(听众) and a panel of judges, who award (small) prizes for the best projects. The biggest rewards, though, are the recognition(承认) — and the chance to have a successful hackathon project graduate to become a full-time real project.

Despite all engineers being given permission from their site lead to participate in such hackathons, many engineers do find it difficult to detach from their day-to-day responsibilities, and so participation rates are generally fairly low (e.g. 5-20%), although many more will attend the initial kick-off and/or the final presentations and may get inspired by the ideas presented.
